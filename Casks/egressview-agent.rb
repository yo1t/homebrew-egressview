  caveats <<~EOS
    EgressView Agent installs a Network Extension to observe outbound
    connections. Before uninstalling, turn it off in
    System Settings > General > Login Items & Extensions > Network Extensions.
    macOS keeps the extension registered otherwise, and the uninstall leaves it
    behind.
